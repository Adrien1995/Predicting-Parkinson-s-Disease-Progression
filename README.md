# Predicting-Parkinson-s-Disease-Progression
Problem Formulation: Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder that causes unintended or
uncontrollable movements, such as shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and
coordination. Symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen over time. As the disease progresses,
people may have difficulty walking and talking. Unfortunately, once contracted there is no cure.
The Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating
Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a comprehensive assessment of both motor and non-motor symptoms
associated with Parkinson's. This project is intended to predict MDS-UPDR scores, which measure
progression in patients with Parkinson's disease using clinically acquired data of protein and
peptide levels over time in subjects with Parkinson’s disease.
